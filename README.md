# Brew Bites

A food and beer pairing application. Created for people that have no idea what to eat and/or drink but love to do both!

## How it Works
Users can search based on a dish name, favorite kind of food or just a main ingredient and Brew Bites will return five beers that have dishes related to their search term. Each beer in the results can be selected to reveal a full description of the beer and the dish that pairs well. Based on the image, time to make and ingredients list a decision can be made in just a few clicks. To access the selected recipe just click on the image of the desired dish and suddenly the headache of what to eat and drink becomes a thing of the past.
